        <p>I enlisted in the military when I was still 17 years old under DEP (Delayed Entry Program). That meant I had already sighned 
            my contract and was shipping out as soon as I turned 18. I did my BCT and AIT at FT. Sill Oklahoma. When I graduated I was 
            sent to my first duty station in South Korea stationed at Camp Hovey. After a one year Ironman tour there I was PCSd over to 
            FT.Hood. Not long after I went to NTC the national training center to prepare for deployment. I went over to Iraq with the 1st 
            Cavlary division. After we closed down COS Echo in Iraq we crossed the border over to Kuwait. Not long after returning to 
            the USA I ETSd.
